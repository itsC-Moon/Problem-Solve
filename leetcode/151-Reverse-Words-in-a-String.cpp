/*
    Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
    A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
    Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
    Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. 
    The returned string should only have a single space separating the words.
    Do not include any extra spaces.
    Example
    Input: s = "the sky is blue"
    Output: "blue is sky the"
